# Roundcube IMAP Library
A IMAP Library written in PHP that is able to handle most messages generated by nowadays E-Mail Clients (Outlook, Apple Mail, MobileMe, ...)

## History
I was looking for nice and feature-complete IMAP Library in PHP that is able to deal with Apple's Inline-Attachments and all the rough things that todays email clients produce. I didn't find anything that could cope with the test-mails I had but I noticed that [Roundcube Webmail](http://roundcube.net/) was able to fiddle the nasty parts (inline attachments & Co.) out of my test messages.
So I decided to cut the neccessary pieces out of Roundcube and use them as a Library that could interface with my application.
